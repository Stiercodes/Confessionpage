        <p>You asked me why do I love you so much<br>
        To be honest I really don't know<br>
        I love taking care of you<br>
        I just want to care about you for my whole life<br>
        Whenever you will get fever I want to stay beside of you.....<br>
        Whenever you will be facing headache I want to calm your head.....<br>
        Whenever you are going through your periods I want to calm your legs and make your favourite food and feed it to you.....<br>
        Whenever you will be happy I want to laugh with you<br>
        Whenever you will be sad I want to make you laugh<br>
        Whenever you will cry I want to wipe your tears with my hands<br>
        Making you happy as much as your parents do is not possible for me,<br>
        but I can surely meet your expectations<br>
        And even after knowing you don't have feelings for me<br>
        just remember,<br>
        खड़ा हूँ आज भी वहीं,<br>
        कि दिल फिर बेक़रार है |<br>
        खड़ा हूँ आज भी वहीं,<br>
        कि तेरा इंतज़ार है |<br>
        I don't want  you to be my girlfriend, I want you to be my life partner<br>
        I don't want any relationship from you right now<br>
        I am not really interested in kissing, meeting daily, hook ups and all<br>
        I love to think about happiness and not pleasure<br>
        I want to sit at marines with you beside me and talk about all the moments we had together....<br>
        I don’t want to give you expensive gifts I want to give you a place in my life….<br>
        And why cant bestfriends be together?<br>
        I gave you 100 reasons to leave me but you still stood with me thats the type of person I want in my life<br>
        I want you to be permanent in my life<br>
        I might be emotional but there are only few people for whom I have cried and you are one of them<br>
        I am improvising myself in every single thing<br>
        Behaviour, Toxicity, Fitness, Studies, Career<br>
        If it was about attraction I would have moved on till now but it’s about attachment<br>
        The day we didn’t talk You didn’t feel anything IK but<br>
        I was feeling it, it felt like something was missing in my day<br>
        It really hurts knowing whats gonna happen and still loving you and knowing you wont realise my efforts ever<br>
        I will take efforts forever till the day you are with someone else<br>
        I really don’t know when will you feel for me but I can’t love anyone else than you<br>
        Tu meri aadat ban gayi hai aur aadatein kabhi bhualyi nahi jaa sakti.....<br>
        Either you will be the biggest heartbreak or the biggest happiness in my life<br>
        I will love you forever❤️</p>
